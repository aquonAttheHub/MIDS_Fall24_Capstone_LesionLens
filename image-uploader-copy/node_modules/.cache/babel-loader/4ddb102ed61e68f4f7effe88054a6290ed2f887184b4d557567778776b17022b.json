Early-stage melanomas, along with other malignant skin lesions, are often difficult to differentiate from benign lesions by visual examination alone, even for trained clinicians. Thus, diagnostic processes for skin lesions are inefficient, with unnecessary biopsy rates reaching up to 99.9% (International Skin Imaging Collaboration, n.d.), leading to higher healthcare costs and potentially exacerbating patient anxiety. Additionally, even in areas with access to dermatological care, patients face barriers such as high costs and long wait times. In the United States, the average out-of-pocket cost for an uninsured dermatology appointment is over $150, and wait times for consultations can extend up to 78 days (Walk-in Dermatology, n.d-a, n.d.-b). The health risks associated with delayed or missed melanoma diagnoses emphasize the need to improve visual diagnostic accuracy for skin lesions. The five-year survival rate of this skin cancer ranges from 99% for stage 1 to 30% for stage 4 melanoma (Healthline, 2023). Given the rapid growth of smartphones and mobile health solutions, there is a promising opportunity to enhance access to care through direct-to-consumer tele-consultation services for skin lesions.
